ABSTRACT = {The On-Board Diagnostics II (OBD-II) system, driven by a wide range of embedded sensors, has revolutionized the automotive industry by enabling real-time monitoring of key vehicle parameters such as engine load, vehicle speed, throttle position, and diagnostic trouble codes. Concurrently, recent advancements in machine learning (ML) have further expanded the capabilities of OBD-II applications, unlocking advanced, intelligent, and data-centric functionalities that significantly surpass those of conventional methodologies. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into ML-based applications that leverage OBD-II sensor data, aiming to enhance sustainability, operational efficiency, safety, and security in modern vehicular systems. To this end, a diverse set of ML approaches is examined, encompassing supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning (RL), deep learning (DL), and hybrid models intended to support advanced driving analytics tasks such as fuel optimization, emission control, driver behavior analysis, anomaly detection, cybersecurity, road perception, and driving support. Furthermore, this paper synthesizes recent research contributions and practical implementations, identifies prevailing challenges, and outlines prospective research directions.},

abstract={Building a high-performance and scalable system has always been a challenge in tracking systems. At the root of this problem lies the excessive and real-time data overload. This paper aims to replace traditional approaches with big data approaches. In this study, a new big data ecosystem design for vehicle tracking system architecture is presented. The aim is to process real-time and extremely fast-generated location/tracking data very fast and increase the overall system performance. The process speed performance of the newly developed big data ecosystem is compared with the table query speed performance of a relational database. As a result of the comparison, the query speed of the big data ecosystem was found to be much faster than that of the relational database management system.},

ABSTRACT = {In industry, dashboards are often used to monitor fleets of assets, such as trains, machines or buildings. In such industrial fleets, the vast amount of sensors evolves continuously, new sensor data exchange protocols and data formats are introduced, new visualization types may need to be introduced and existing dashboard visualizations may need to be updated in terms of displayed sensors. These requirements motivate the development of dynamic dashboarding applications. These, as opposed to fixed-structure dashboard applications, allow users to create visualizations at will and do not have hard-coded sensor bindings. The state-of-the-art in dynamic dashboarding does not cope well with the frequent additions and removals of sensors that must be monitored—these changes must still be configured in the implementation or at runtime by a user. Also, the user is presented with an overload of sensors, aggregations and visualizations to select from, which may sometimes even lead to the creation of dashboard widgets that do not make sense. In this paper, we present a dynamic dashboard that overcomes these problems. Sensors, visualizations and aggregations can be discovered automatically, since they are provided as RESTful Web Things on a Web Thing Model compliant gateway. The gateway also provides semantic annotations of the Web Things, describing what their abilities are. A semantic reasoner can derive visualization suggestions, given the Thing annotations, logic rules and a custom dashboard ontology. The resulting dashboarding application automatically presents the available sensors, visualizations and aggregations that can be used, without requiring sensor configuration, and assists the user in building dashboards that make sense. This way, the user can concentrate on interpreting the sensor data and detecting and solving operational problems early.},

ABSTRACT = {Urban vehicular emissions, a major contributor to environmental degradation, demand accurate methodologies that reflect real-world driving conditions. This study presents a telemetric data-driven framework for assessing emissions of Carbon Monoxide (CO), Hydrocarbons (HCs), and Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) in real-world scenarios. By utilizing Vehicle Specific Power (VSP) calculations, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), and Ensemble Isolation Forests (EIFs), the framework identifies high-risk driving behaviors and maps high-emission zones. Achieving a Silhouette Score of 0.72 for clustering and a precision of 0.88 in anomaly detection, the study provides actionable insights for policymakers to mitigate urban emissions. Spatial–temporal analysis highlights critical high-emission areas, offering strategies for urban planners to reduce environmental impacts. The findings underscore the potential of interventions such as speed regulation and driving behavior modifications in lowering emissions. Future extensions of this work will include hybrid and electric vehicles, alongside the integration of granular environmental factors like weather conditions, to enhance the framework’s accuracy and applicability. By addressing the complexities of real-world emissions, this study contributes to bridging significant knowledge gaps and advancing sustainable urban mobility solutions.},

ABSTRACT = {The rapid development of Intelligent Connected Vehicles (ICVs) and the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has paved the way for new real-time monitoring and control systems. However, most existing telemetry solutions remain limited by high costs, reliance on cellular networks, lack of modularity, and insufficient field validation in competitive scenarios. To address this gap, this study presents the design, implementation, and real-world validation of a low-cost telemetry platform for electric race vehicles. The system integrates an ESP32-based data acquisition unit, LoRaWAN long-range communication, and real-time visualization via Node-RED on a Raspberry Pi gateway. The platform supports multiple sensors (voltage, current, temperature, Global Positioning System (GPS), speed) and uses a FreeRTOS multi-core architecture for efficient task distribution and consistent data sampling. Field testing was conducted during Colombia’s 2024 National Electric Drive Vehicle Competition (CNVTE), under actual race conditions. The telemetry system achieved sensor accuracy exceeding 95%, stable LoRa transmission with low latency, and consistent performance throughout the competition. Notably, teams using the system reported up to 12% improvements in energy efficiency compared to baseline trials, confirming the system’s technical feasibility and operational impact under real race conditions. This work contributes to the advancement of IoV research by providing a modular, replicable, and cost-effective telemetry architecture, field-validated for use in high-performance electric vehicles. The architecture generalizes to urban e-mobility fleets for energy-aware routing, predictive maintenance, and safety monitoring.},
